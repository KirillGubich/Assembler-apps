The game "Guess the Number." The computer makes a number from 1 to 100 inclusive. 
The user is given 10 attempts to guess it. 
Each attempt is that the user enters the estimated number and receives one of the answers:
The intended number is greater.
The intended number is less.
The number is guessed.


If the number could not be guessed from 10 attempts, a message is displayed:
The number NN is not guessed from 10 attempts. (NN is the desired number)


Incorrect input (everything except numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive) is not considered an attempt.
